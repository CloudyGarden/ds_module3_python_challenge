In this pybank challenge, I created a python script to anaylze a dataset and turn back the following values:
    The total number of months included in the dataset

    The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period

    The changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period, and then the average of those changes

    The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period

    The greatest decrease in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
I used knowledge learned from class, class lectures, and code from the xpert to help me.
